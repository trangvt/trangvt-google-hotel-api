2) Room Bundle pricing and availability
Use a <RoomBundle> element inside the <Result> element of a Transaction message for each package/itinerary combination.

The ordering is as follows, from lowest to highest precedence
<PartnerData>
<PropertyData>
<RoomData>, where the <RoomID> matches the <RoomID> in the <RoomBundle> block
<PackageData>, where the <PackageID> matches the <PackageID> in the <RoomBundle> block
